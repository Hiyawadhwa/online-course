                <h3>Learn Web Development In The Easiest Way</h3>
                <P>Website development is important because it allows businesses and individuals to create a presence on the internet. 
                    A website is a great way to showcase your products or services, connect with potential customers and build your brand.</P>

                    <p>A website makes your business or personal brand visible to potential customers all over the world. People 
                        can easily find your website by searching for keywords related to your business or interests on Google or other search engines.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <P>When learning how to develop a website, you must answer: 
                        What exactly is a website? A website is the collection of web pages which a creator writes using HTML or code (or creates using a DIY low-code, no-code platform like Wix). These web pages are stored, or hosted, on a computer server constantly connected to the internet.
                         In order to be a fully functioning website, it must have the following:</P>
                         <br><br>
                         <P>Address: Just like a house or business needs an address to be found, so do websites. A website address is called the URL (Uniform Resource Locators). In order for a website to be accessed it needs a URL name. A website also has a domain name, such as wix.com. The domain name is the overall name of the website, while the URL will take you to any specific page within that website.

                            Homepage: This is the first page welcoming people to the website. Upon landing on a homepage, people get an immediate sense of what the website is about. It also acts as a gateway to the rest of the web pages throughout the site.
                            
                            Design: The overall look and feel of the website through graphics, images, colors, typography, navigation, flow and experience
                            
                            Content: What each page in
